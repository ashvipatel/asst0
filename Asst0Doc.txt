DESIGN/GAME PLAN

	File Structure.
	
		Asst0Doc.tx

		data/
			test input CSV file(s)
			test output CVS file(s)

		Makefile

		source/
			simpleCSVsort.c
				include libraries and header file
				main function
				ETC ... ?

			simpleCSVsort.h
				define macros (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, etc...)
				define struct "record" corresponding to each row of the CSV
					 - struct
						- three fields: void * key, char * [200?] full_record, record * next
						- key will hold the value to be sorted on
						- full_record will hold the entire record, formatted as in input file
						- record * next will be used to connect all records in a linked list
				define struct "node"
					- node will have two fields: struct record and 
				include libraries (mergesort.c)
				printCSV( ) function ??
				ETC ... ?

			mergesort.c
				mergesort aort function
					attempt to make it protable w/ function pointers?

	simpleCSVsort.c
	 - main()
		- error check commnd line arguments
			- set stderr appropriately and exit if arguments incorrect/!match
		- make character buffer (size 20 or 30 ?) 
			- is it better to have an oversized buffer and not realloc mid comma?
		- read input one char at a time
			if ( ch != ',' )
				transfer buffer to record, clear buffer, continue
			else if ( ch is invalid )
				exit on stderr
			else
				add ch to buffer, continue
		- build linked list of records	
		- call mergesort() on the linked list of records
		- call printCSV() on the sorted list of records

	simpleCSVsort.h
		#define STDIN 0
		#define STDOUT 1
		#define STDERR 2
		- printfCSV()
			- TO BE CONTINUED

	mergesort.c
		- mergesort()
			sort on the linked list of records.
